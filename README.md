<p align = "justify">I am a software developer who recently graduated from Makers Academy BootCamp in London. I have a strong background in business and Law in Spain. After a year of working and developing my own business and legal practice, I felt the desire to work on something that has a stronger impact on the user's life.

<p align ="jusfify">I have always, in my professional career, been involved in fields that require strong problem-solving skills and leading teams to work effectively and in a goal-oriented manner. The latter and my passion for tech and help my customers with the best possible outcome have brought me to the software engineering field, to fulfil my passion for helping others, improve their lives and build a better world through tech.

## SKILLS

- <b>Quick learner.</b>
I can engage any intellectual or learning activity and in a short amount of time getting enough insight to offer solutions. Along with my past professional activities, I have been challenged many times with new learning needs in several fields. Relating to tech I have shown this skill during my education in Makers and still in the present day. I have to learn how to program a develop app in just 12 weeks, and I did it with success, working on my own and in teams.
- <b>Excellent Communicator</b>
As a Lawyer and a General Manager I have developed the skill of clearly communicate problems and look for the correct answers from clients, providers, or partners. In my professional career due to the characteristic of the responsibilities I have held, I have been in the need of cooperating with others regularly, being this skill a key component of my activities. In tech, I have used this skill almost every day along with my pair-programming session when It is essential to explain ideas accurately and ask for correct information. When I have worked in teams withing more complicated projects, my communication skill has arisen as a super important one in our daily meetings to set expectations, discussing problems and discuss ideas in the implementation of the product.

- <b>Team Player</b>
Linked with being proficient in communication I have developed through my years of labour experiences the skill to cooperate with others and learn how to do a job within a team of professionals. Sometimes being lead, sometimes as a leader, always with a humble perspective, learning from others strong points, opinions and experience, adding my ones when required, always having in mind the task and the service to the client.
- <b>Problem Solver</b>
 Since the very beginning of my career the main part of the job I have been in has consisted in to resolve problems daily. Due to that, I have developed the ability to deal with a high level of stress, general organisation skills to be able to prioritize what is important and a high understanding of how resolves a problem dividing them into small tasks which become doable. In tech, this problem-solving skill has been tested almost every day. Being my approach about problems trying not to be overwhelmed and once I have the general picture try to solve the problems step by step escalating since little problems I know how to solve to finally tackle the whole scenario.
